# A Little RSPCT
Classifying the parent subreddit of a reddit self-post

Group P13 Type 2 Project for CSI4106 Fall 2019

The problem we decided to study was extreme multi-classification in the realm of Natural Language Processing. We explored this problem by trying to classify the parent subreddit of a reddit self-post based on the post's text. Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website composed of subreddits. Each subreddit is a forum dedicated to a specific topic such as r/computerscience, r/movies, r/blackmirror, etc.  With more than 1 million unique subreddits and 300 million users, we thought reddit posts were a perfect candidate to build an extreme multi-classification model.

Our dataset came from the RSPCT (Reddit Self-Post Classification Task) on Kaggle which contains 1,013,000 million rows (1 post per row) from 1,000 curated subreddits.  

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks used to train our classification models.
